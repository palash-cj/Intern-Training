<!-- Execution stack -->

<script>
    var a="hello";
    function b(){
        debugger;
        console.log("how are you ?");
        c();

        function c(){
            debugger;
            console.log("how old are you");
        }
    }
    console.log(a);
    debugger;
    b();
</script>

<!-- code execution explanation:
1. a...(console.log(a)); Global execution context gets generate and pushed into execution stack
2. debugger blockes the code before b()
3. js engine calls the function b & new execution context for fun b gets push into execution stack
4. debugger blovks the code;
5. consoles "how are you"
6. function c is called & new execution context for fun c gets pushed into execution stack
7. debugger blocks the code
8. consoles "how old are you"
9. execution context for fun c gets popped
10. execution context for fun b gets popped
11. Only global stack as 'anonymous' remains in the stack -->
